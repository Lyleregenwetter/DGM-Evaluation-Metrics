# DGM-Evaluation-Metrics

This dataset and code are presented in the paper: [Beyond Statistical Similarity: Rethinking Metrics for Deep Generative Models in Engineering Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02913)


Also check out the [Project page](http://decode.mit.edu/projects/metrics/).

This repo contains implementations for:
- 20 evaluation metrics
- 20 dataset constructors, objective functions, and constraint functions
- Generative Adversarial Network and Conditional GAN
- Variational Autoencoder and Conditional VAE
- Multi-Objective Pefromance-Aware Diverse GAN
- Design Target Achievement Index GAN
- Plotting distribution matching, constraint satisfaction, and performance achievement problems on 2D data
